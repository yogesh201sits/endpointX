# 🚀 EndpointX

**From Prompt → Live Backend in Seconds**

EndpointX is an **AI-powered backend generator** that converts a simple natural language prompt into a **fully functional backend with live API endpoints**.

Instead of manually creating servers, routes, controllers, and database logic, EndpointX allows developers to simply **describe what they want**, and the system generates and runs the backend automatically.

# 💡 The Problem

Many developers have great project ideas but get stuck when building the backend.

Common issues:

- Building APIs from scratch is **repetitive**
- Existing APIs rarely **match exact requirements**
- Setting up servers, routes, and testing takes **too much time**

EndpointX solves this by **automating backend creation using AI.**

# ⚙️ How EndpointX Works

```

Prompt
↓
AI Agent (LangChain)
↓
Backend Code Generation
↓
Sandbox Execution (E2B)
↓
Live API Endpoints
↓
API Playground Testing

```

With EndpointX you can:

- Generate a **complete backend from a prompt**
- Run the backend in an **isolated sandbox**
- Get a **live server URL with working APIs**
- Test APIs instantly in the **API Playground**
- Automatically detect **request parameters and input fields**

No boilerplate.  
No manual configuration.  

Just **Ideas → Working APIs.**

# 🧠 Backend Architecture

The backend contains an **AI layer responsible for LangChain orchestration**.

Responsibilities include:

- Handling user prompts
- Interacting with the LLM
- Generating backend code
- Preparing sandbox environments
- Running generated servers using **E2B**

The **node-e2b-template** folder contains a **Node.js server template** used inside the E2B sandbox to execute the generated backend code.

If you want, I can also make a **🔥 “Top 1% GitHub style README”** with:

- badges
- architecture diagram
- GIF demo
- AI workflow diagram
- better repo structure

That version looks **much more impressive to recruiters**.
